Security is integrated throughout the pipeline:

Security scanning workflow with Trivy
Example of integrating security checks into the CI/CD process

Disaster Recovery and High Availability
We showcase basic disaster recovery practices:

Backup script for critical data
Discussion of high availability strategies

Microservices Architecture
This part demonstrates a basic microservices setup:

Docker Compose file for local development of microservices
Discussion of microservices best practices
